The aim of the game is to catch as many puppies as possible by clicking on them when they appear. In the event of successful click, the pup count will increment and the pup will disappear.

## Instructions

There are 2 levels in this game.
##### Level 1
The level 1 game starts within 3 seconds on clicking "Let's Play" button in the first page. To unlock level 1, the player has to catch more than 2 puppies, else hit the restart button to retry.

##### Level 2
Once level 1 finishes, the player enters level 2 within 3 seconds of hitting 'Next Level' button. The duration of this level is 50 seconds. Watch out for Sniper the fox here, as clicking on the fox will decrement the pups caught.

The game is best experienced in Google Chrome.

## Implementation
The game was built with the help of jQuery. First page is the 'index_old.html' which redirects to index2.html. The game starts as soon as (within 3 seconds) the window of 'index2.html' loads and is achieved by implementing setTimeout() on startGame().
