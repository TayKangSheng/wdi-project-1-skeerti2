-->
Your aim in the game is to catch as many puppies as possible by clicking on them when they appear in the rectangles. In the event of successful click, the pup count will increment and the pup will disappear. As your level 1 finishes, you might want to watch out for Sniper the fox, as clicking on the fox will decrement the pup count.

The level 1 game starts within 3 seconds on clicking "Let's Play" button in the first page
